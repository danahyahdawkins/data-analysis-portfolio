# SQL Intermediate Projects
This folder contains projects that demonstrate a more advanced understanding of SQL. Projects may include tasks such as using aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG`, performing complex joins (e.g., inner, outer, and self joins), working with subqueries, and manipulating data with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
